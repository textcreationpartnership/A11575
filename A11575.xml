            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2752:3"/>
Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> drew neere towards with the moſt part of his Forces, but I judged it ſo important, to cauſe to be knowne at the entrance of his Majeſties Armes into this Province, that I would not refuſe to giue protection to people that would ſerue him. As I paſſed over all theſe conſiderations, and God hath ſo favoured me, that after I had held the aſſieged compaſſed as ſtraite as might be, the twelfth day, which was the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> they were conſtrained to Capitulate, and to depart out of the place the firſt of this Moneth. I ſent to the King the Capitulation, and humbly entreated his Majeſtie to commaund, that the pardon which I haue promiſed to theſe people might be ſent vnto me. I haue left in the Caſtle one Company of the Regiment of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blay,</hi> and committed the keeping of the Towne to the Inhabitants. Monſieur <hi>de Roques</hi> will certifie his Majeſtie of the importance of the place, and that it was of ſuch a conſequence to reduce it to his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as without this all the little Townes of <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez,</hi> would never be kept in their obedience. The happie end of this enterpriſe hath produced effects farre more advantageous, which were, that this hath obliged the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> to ſet forward themſelues with all diligence to ſuccour this place, with 3000. foote, and 2000. horſe. Many voluntary Nobles, and three peices of Canon, whereof having notice, and that they were but three myles off vs, I reſolved with the advice of the Marquis <hi>de Breze,</hi> who made me the firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thereof, that at the ſame houre that the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of St. <hi>Felix</hi> ſhould be finiſhed, that I would

goe directly to the enemie, with two deſignes, the one to Combate with them, the other to ſaue <hi>Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau d'Ary,</hi> which they made full account was theirs. The place of St. <hi>Felix</hi> being ſuccoured, or fayling to follow their Army. Our determinations haue (thankes be vnto God) ſo proſperouſly ſucceeded, that arriving halfe a mile from this Towne, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Breze,</hi> who conducted the head of the Army, certified me, that he ſaw that of the Enemy on the left hand within two Muſquet ſhot of our way, and that he beleeved, that they being to paſſe a River, whoſe bankes were inacceſſible, vpon a very long bridge; the deſigne of the enemies was to ſuffer halfe of our Armie to paſſe, which contained but a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, foure Companies of the Regiments of his Majeſties Guards, and ſix of thoſe of <hi>Chamblay,</hi> and then to ſet vpon the Arriere guard, and that there was vpon the ſame River a good paſſage two thouſand paces higher, where if I pleaſed he would cauſe the Avant-guard to paſſe over. I commended his judicious advice, and told him that he could not doe better than that he had propounded; Wee had gained the paſſage, and halfe of the Army was on the other ſide the River, before the enemies could judge what we would doe, in ſuch ſort, that all the troupes paſſed over, without the advancing forward of one man of the enemies to come vnto vs. The River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed, we ſet our ſelues in Battaile-aray in a great Field, and ſet all the baggage vpon our right hand towards <hi>Caſtelnaud' Ary.</hi> The enemies ſeeing they had fayled of their deſigne, reſolved to paſſe the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and to come lodge vpon our way of <hi>Caſtlenau d'
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2752:4"/>
Ary,</hi> in places very advantageous for the Infante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; which ſeeing, I reſolved to get before them, and place the Armie of the King betweene <hi>Caſtlenau d' Ary</hi> and the enemies, to charge them when I ſhould ſee part of their people paſſed on this ſide the River. The place of Battaile which I ſent the Lords <hi>de l'Iſle</hi> and <hi>Eſpenay</hi> to view, ſeemed the faireſt place in the world; the which they having deſcribed vnto me, I cauſed the Armie diligently to ſet forward, and we had not leyſure to ſet our ſelues in order, when ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemies would haue paſſed in great haſte, I reſolved not to deferre, Charging them, and the foure Companies of the Regiment of his Majeſties Guard having ſeparated the body of the Battalia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, the one to take the right hand of our Cavallerie, and the other the left; and the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie men of the Regiment of <hi>Chamblay</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere the ſaid Battalia on the left hand, I cauſed the Avant Couriers to ſet forward, and we marched forthwith againſt the enemy, who were encamped along the high-way in houſes and in ditches very advantageous, the diſcharge of the Infanterie being made, and likewiſe that of the enemies, our Cavalle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (in the front of whom the Marquis <hi>de Breze</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelfe) would goe vnto them by the right hand and by the left, but the moſt part of them met with ſo great ditches, that it was impoſſible for them to paſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carabins</hi> found a way more to the purpoſe then the other, and paſſing the firſt made their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vpon their enemies, which ſo ſtrongly reſiſted them with their Infantery, that they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

further; <hi>Arnauld</hi> and <hi>Bideyran</hi> valiantly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelues therein, and the laſt hath ſlaine the Lord <hi>de la Feuillade.</hi>

            <p>During theſe actions on both ſides, Monſieur <hi>de Lauriers</hi> and <hi>de Beau-regard Champron,</hi> who ſought a paſſage for to depart out of the field, and to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way, found the paſſage very hard, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe reſolved with themſelues, to adventure into the way, where being deſcended, with the ſonne of the ſaid <hi>Laurier,</hi> and twelue or fifteene of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, the Duke of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> came to charge them with an hundred Gentlemen; They withſtood the ſhocke, where the ſaid Duke was hurt, the Count <hi>de Rieux</hi> ſlaine, and foure or fiue others borne to the ground; our Muſquettiers diſcharging vpon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallery, droue many of them from the fight, in ſuch ſort, that in an inſtant the Duke <hi>de Montmorancie</hi> was abandoned of all thoſe that followed, except foure or fiue, the which he ſeeing, and being incenſed with his wounds, he found meanes to depart out of the way, with thoſe few that remained with him, and entring into the field, met my Company of men of Armes, gaue and received ſome blowes by ſword and Piſtoll in paſſing, and proceeded forward vntill he came before the Troupes of the Guards and <hi>Chamblay,</hi> where he being ſhot at by many Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, his Horſe which had beene alreadie very much hurt by Monſieur <hi>de Lauriers</hi> fell, and he vpon him, where he was taken by the Officers and Souldiers of the Regiment of Guards.</p>

the Marquis <hi>de Breze,</hi> and my ſelfe thought it fitting that having made one ſo ſucceſſefull incounter, wherein were ſlaine ſo many men of qualitie, it was not neceſſary to hazard a ſecond, and we having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained an houre on our place of fight, without any ſhew of the enemies advancing forward.</p>
            <p>I commaunded that they ſhould beginne to retire themſelues towards <hi>Caſtelnau-d' Ary,</hi> cauſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate alſo the Companies of the Guards, and thoſe of <hi>Chamblay.</hi>

               <p>THe Kings Forces vnder the commaund of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de la Force</hi> in <hi>Lanquedock,</hi> being poſſeſſed of the Towne of <hi>Bocaire,</hi> and laying ſiege to the Caſtle which was poſſeſſed by the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which ſaid Caſtle would be very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to the King, if he could gaine it. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> vnderſtanding that the Kings forces had laid ſiege to the ſaid Caſtle, reſolved to relieve the ſame with all ſpeed, ſpecially conſidering the ſaid Caſtle was but poorely provided either of Munition or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals to hold out long. Wherefore he cauſed 3000. Foote and 400. Horſe to march towards it, with all manner of proviſion, both Munition and Victuals for reliefe of the ſame, vnder a young, valiant, and vigorous Commaunder, called the Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Delbeufe,</hi> who made little account of any reſiſtance that the King had there to hinder his purpoſe. On the other ſide, that old and well experienced Souldier (though foureſcore yeares of age, and whoſe Army did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but of 800. Foote and 400. Horſe) vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſetting forward of his and the Kings ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (with ſo great and farre exceeding a number of Foote, and ſo well provided to offend) thought it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2752:6"/>
not fit to continue in the Towne, and onely to make reſiſtance by way of Defence. Now this braue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Commaunder (who had beene alwayes faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſerviceable to his Prince) would not in his laſt dayes ſuffer either in Honour or fidelitie to his Prince, ſpeedily drawes all his Forces out of the Towne, and goes to meete with his enemy, with his 800. Foote and 400. Horſe. Vpon the approach of both Armies, the encounter was furious and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and continued long doubtfull, till at laſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Duke <hi>Delbeufe</hi> was quite overthrowne, and onely himſelfe &amp; two more eſcaped with their liues, all his whole Army being either kild or taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. I thinke the like Victory hath not beene obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the memory of man. Vpon this, <hi>De la Force</hi> returned againe with his priſoners and baggage to his ſiege of <hi>Bocaire</hi>-Caſtle, where it is ſuppoſed the ſaid Caſtle will not long hold out, but not onely that Caſtle, but alſo all thoſe places which held out againſt the King, will likewiſe yeeld themſelues.</p>
               <p>It is reported that the Monſieur hath ſent to the King his brother, to deſire the life of <hi>Montmorancie,</hi> and that he may be reſtored to all his Honours and meanes; which they ſay, the King hath granted him. It is hoped, that there will be ſome accord made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and him very ſhortly.</p>
